Spectacle is an interactive, web-based tool for exploring, visualizing, and sharing formal specifications written in the [TLA<sup>+</sup> specification language](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).  The motivation is to have a better way to quickly interact with a formal specification and easily share results. For example, it provides a way to share protocol behaviors and counterexample traces in a convenient, portable, and repeatable manner. 

The tool implements a [full TLA+ interpreter in Javascript](https://github.com/will62794/spectacle/blob/master/js/eval.js), building on top of the [TLA+ tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/tlaplus-community/tree-sitter-tlaplus) for parsing specifications. This allows for interactive exploration of specs natively in the browser, without reliance on an external language server. A live version is hosted [here](https://will62794.github.io/spectacle/#!/home), and below are some example specifications to try out:

<!-- The Javascript interpreter is likely slower than TLC, but highly efficient model checking isn't currently a goal of the tool.  -->

<!-- Note also that you can basically use the existing web interface as a simple TLA+ expression evaluator, since making changes to definitions in the spec should automatically update the set of generated initial states. -->

<!-- This project Utilizes the [TLA+ tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/tlaplus-community/tree-sitter-tlaplus) to provide a web based TLA+ interface for exploring and sharing specifications.  -->
<!-- There are still some TLA+ language features that [may not be implemented](https://github.com/will62794/spectacle/issues), but a reasonable number of specs should be handled correctly. For example, see this [Paxos spec](https://will62794.github.io/spectacle/#!/home?specpath=./specs/Paxos.tla). Additional testing is needed to verify the correctness of this interpreter on more complex specs. -->

<!-- A basic, preliminary test suite can be found [here](https://will62794.github.io/spectacle/test.html). -->


You can also see a live demo of the tool and its features in [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSWmxQLvmw), which also gives a very high level overview of the tool architecture and implementation details. 

## Animations

Spectacle provides an easy way to create animated visualizations of your specifications by defining them in an SVG-based format right in a specification. See [here](./doc/animation.md) for more details on how to define these animations.

## Running Locally

If you would like to run Spectacle locally and offline, you can do so by cloning the repo and running `make serve` from the root directory. This will start up a local Python server serving the app at [`127.0.0.1:8000`](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

<!-- Note that in addition to copying and pasting in the text of a TLA+ spec or writing it in the browser interface, you can also load a spec file from a given URL by using the following URL path format: -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- https://will62794.github.io/spectacle/#!/home?specpath=<tla_spec_url> -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- where `tla_spec_url` is a URL pointing to raw TLA+ module file. For example, you can see that [this link](https://will62794.github.io/tla-web/#!/home?specpath=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/will62794/4250c4b6a8e68b0d9e038186739af8cc/raw/3470b5999f896abb478733e8fc07e7ed9e3039da/HourClock.tla) loads a simple spec from a [personal Github gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/will62794/4250c4b6a8e68b0d9e038186739af8cc/raw/3470b5999f896abb478733e8fc07e7ed9e3039da/HourClock.tla). -->


<!-- ### REPL Mode -->

<!-- You can also open a specification in REPL mode, which gives you access to a live REPL for dynamically evaluating TLA+ expressions in the context of a specification. See [here](https://will62794.github.io/tla-web/#!/home?specpath=./specs/repl.tla&repl=true) for an example REPL scratchpad. -->



## Testing

Currently, nearly all testing of the tool is done via conformance testing against TLC. That is, for a given specification, we [generate its reachable state graph using TLC](https://github.com/will62794/spectacle/blob/0060a9bedfbf78c9c6ef1eacf701b13f85048f5e/specs/with_state_graphs/gen_state_graphs.sh) and compare this for equivalence against the reachable state graph generated by the Javascript interpreter. You can see the result of all current tests that are run on [this page](https://will62794.github.io/spectacle/test.html), and the underlying test specs [here](https://github.com/will62794/spectacle/tree/0060a9bedfbf78c9c6ef1eacf701b13f85048f5e/specs/with_state_graphs).
